# RAG-Chatbot
Welcome to the RAG Chatbot repository! This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions based on the contents of a private PDF document. Built with Python, this chatbot uses advanced NLP techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

ðŸš€ Features
Question Answering on PDFs: Upload your own PDF, and the chatbot will answer questions specifically related to its content.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines retrieval of relevant document chunks with generative response models for accurate and coherent answers.
Conversational Memory: Remembers the context of the conversation to provide more meaningful interactions.
User-Friendly Interface: A streamlined UI built with Streamlit (or specify if you used another UI framework) for easy interaction.
