# RAG-Chatbot
Welcome to the RAG Chatbot repository! This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions based on the contents of a private PDF document. Built with Python, this chatbot uses advanced NLP techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

üöÄ Features
Question Answering on PDFs: Upload your own PDF, and the chatbot will answer questions specifically related to its content.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines retrieval of relevant document chunks with generative response models for accurate and coherent answers.
Conversational Memory: Remembers the context of the conversation to provide more meaningful interactions.
User-Friendly Interface: A streamlined UI built with Streamlit (or specify if you used another UI framework) for easy interaction.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python: The primary language for development.
FastAPI: A high-performance web framework for the backend.
FAISS: For efficient similarity search and information retrieval.
Sentence Transformers: Used to generate embeddings for semantic similarity.
Streamlit: (or specify your UI framework) for the user interface.

üìö How It Works
Text Extraction: Extracts text from a provided PDF.
Chunking: Splits the text into manageable chunks.
Embeddings and Indexing: Generates embeddings for each chunk using Sentence Transformers and indexes them with FAISS.
Query Processing: Matches user queries to relevant document chunks.
Response Generation: Summarizes and generates responses using the RAG approach
